## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This class, Geospatial Programming with ArcPy, was taught to a group of students majoring in Aeronautics and Space at Ecole d'ingénieurs (EPF), as a collaboration with the RUDN University of Moscow. The students had no prior GIS (Geographic Information Systems) experience, and were exposed to programming, GIS and geospatial programming in two weeks time in this intensive course. As all students and the instructor, we are all very proud of the very interesting class projects that resulted from this class. Below are the titles and brief descriptions of the projects (data and source code included!) along with the contact information of students, in the alphabetic order (by last name).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ndilekli/EPF-RUDN-Geo-Prog-2020/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
